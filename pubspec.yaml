  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/logo/
    - assets/animation/
    - assets/icons/categories/
    - assets/banners/
    - assets/products/
    - assets/brands/
    - assets/icons/payment_methods/
    - assets/animation/loading.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: "Nunito"
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-MediumItalic.ttf
          style: italic
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito-Bold.ttf
          weight: 800

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
